<!--
  On your own, reflect on your learning during this challenge by answering the following questions 
  in a commented out section of your template. 

  How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  - It was fun to wireframe with a pair because we were able to bounce ideas off each other and get 
  feedback right away, and my pair asked questions about or thought of things that I haven't thought 
  about.

  Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  - Wireframing was somewhat tedious, but I understand that it will prevent more tedium and headaches 
  later down the road and I think that I will get used to it.  It was definitely helpful to our 
  development process because everything is laid out plainly in front of us, so we can test if something 
  makes sense visually.  This testing is useful because we don't need to waste too much time coding for 
  the style of something that appeared like a cool idea in our heads, but it turns out to be something 
  that we didn't want.  

  What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
  - We decide that a good wireframe will be simple and bare-bones enough, so that the person(s) working on 
  it will not be too invested in the idea, and it will be easier to change the layout/style later since 
  nobody is really that invested in the style/layout.

  But the wireframe must still be able to communicate the intention of each section and what needs to go where.  

  For example, 2 months later I can look at the wireframe and be able to figure out relatively 
  quickly what I was thinking at that time.  Even better, in real life these things are worked 
  on by teams.  If the wireframe is good, everyone would be happier and more efficient and less 
  confused if they can understand what the intention of the designer is.  

  What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
  - <nav></nav>.  

  There's something that I'm a bit confused about, which are the "<section></section>" tags and the 
  "<main></main>" tags.  I have read about <section></section> tags from a different blog, and I found 
  out about <main></main> tags because of 
  https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-code/blob/master/week-1/blog-template.html.  

  My question about <main></main> = when I look at other code samples, I don't really see it used that 
  much, and also it does not auto-fill.  Why is that?

  My question about <section></section> & <select></select> = how does one know when to use this and when 
  to use <div></div>?
